# Orbit Control
    - Orbit controls allow the camera to orbit around a target.
    - Orbit controls are not part of the core three.js library, but are included in the examples folder.
    - It takes in a camera and a domElement as arguments.
    - Has a bunch of properties that can be set. And a bunch of methods that can be called.
    - More in the docs & in the orbit control project in the introToThreeJS folder
# Geometries 
    -Lots of different geometries in three.js
    - https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry <--- docs
    - You can put wireframe:true on the geometry to see the wireframe of the geometry
    - BufferGeometry is a more efficient way of storing geometries.
    - BufferGeometry has less properties than Geometry
    - You can make a geometry from scratch by defining the vertices and faces refer to introToThreeJS/geometries for more info also the docs 
    
# Textures
    - Textures are images that are wrapped around the geometry.
    - You can use a texture loader to load in a texture.
